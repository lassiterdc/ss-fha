# Implementation Plan (Consolidated Prompt)

Design a complete implementation plan **before coding**. The goal is to reduce ambiguity, prevent mid-stream rework, and make execution straightforward.

## When to Use

This prompt will be used when called by the user. The expectation is that the user will pass this file as context followed by a filename for the planning document before explaining the task. If a filename is not explicitely provided, recommend one to the user before writing the plan to a file.

## Purpose

Produce a clear, repo-aware plan that:
- captures requirements and assumptions,
- identifies all impacted files and dependencies,
- includes validation and documentation updates,
- surfaces user decisions early,
- and is ready to execute with minimal back-and-forth.

## Required Discovery (Before Planning)

Review enough context to produce a grounded plan:

1. "ss-fha/.prompts/philosphy.md" for project rules, development philosophy, and potentially relevant examples from the TRITON-SWMM_toolkit codebase
2. Existing implementation patterns in `src/` and related tests in `tests/`
3. Any directly referenced files from the user request

## Plan Output Location (Default)

By default, write the implementation plan to:

`docs/planning/active/`

Use a suitable subdirectory when applicable:
- `docs/planning/active/features/`
- `docs/planning/active/refactors/`
- `docs/planning/active/bugs/`

Use a descriptive snake_case filename ending in `.md`.

If the user does **not** request a different destination, this default is required.

If the plan is very long, consider creating a subdirectory of the plan with a master planning document and planning docs for each self-contained work unit prefixed with an alphanumeric character for alphabetical sorting. Include an 'implemented' subdirectory in which we will move plans that have been completed.

## Planning Workflow

1. Restate the task and success criteria in your own words
2. Identify constraints, dependencies, and likely edge cases
3. Propose approach options (briefly), then select one with rationale
4. Build a phased implementation sequence (prep → code changes → validation)
5. List open decisions that require user confirmation before implementation

## Required Output Format

Use **exactly** these headings, in this order:

0. Header with datetime of writing and datetime of last edit with a short summary of the edit. 

1. `## Task Understanding`
   - Requirements
   - Assumptions
   - Success criteria

2. `## Evidence from Codebase`
   - Bullet list of files inspected and key findings

3. `## Implementation Strategy`
   - Chosen approach
   - Alternatives considered (1-3 bullets)
   - Trade-offs

4. `## File-by-File Change Plan`
   - For each file: purpose of change + expected impact
   - Include new files, modified files, and any deletions
   - Call out import sites that must be updated

5. `## Risks and Edge Cases`
   - Technical risks and mitigations
   - Edge cases to explicitly validate

6. `## Validation Plan`
   - Specific commands/tests to run
   - Include smoke tests when changes are significant (note only local, non-HPC specific smoke tests can be run during development)

7. `## Documentation and Tracker Updates`
   - Docs that may need updates (e.g., `.prompts/philosphy.md`, planning documents, or others)
   - Conditions that trigger those updates

8. `## Decisions Needed from User`
   - Questions that block implementation
   - If proceeding with assumptions, label each assumption with risk level (low/medium/high)

9. `## Definition of Done`
   - Concrete completion checklist

## Project Guardrails

- Do **not** add backward-compatibility shims unless explicitly requested
- Update all import sites immediately when moving/renaming modules
- Keep plan actionable: avoid vague steps like “refactor as needed”
- Software development best practices should be implemented where possible. Don't assume the user is an expert software developer.

## Plan Quality Self-Check (Required)

After drafting the plan, perform and report this check:

1. **Header/body alignment check**
   - Do all section headers accurately match the content in their section body?
   - If not, rename headers or revise content until aligned.

2. **Section necessity check**
   - Are all sections necessary?
   - If any section can be removed without losing important context or actionable guidance, remove it.

3. **Alignment with .prompts/philosophy.md check**
   - Does the approach align with the design philosphy of this project?
   - Are there any adjustments that should be made to make the plan abide by good software development practices?

Report a short “Self-Check Results” summary at the end.

## Approval Gate

Return the plan only.

Do **not** implement code changes yet. Wait for user approval before editing files or running destructive commands.
